                    <h4>SERATO PUBLISHES A SERIES OF SONG ARRANGEMENT TIPS FOR BEAT MAKERS</h4>
                    <p>A song goes through many different stages as it’s being created, and song arrangement is one of the most critical parts of music production. We already know that making a beat involves taking different elements and putting them together to create your finished track. Serato Studio helps you get your ideas out quickly by structuring your songs in loops and scenes. But what happens after you have your initial idea? How do you take a loop you’ve created and turn it into a full song? This is song arrangement, and it’s something that beginner beat makers often have a hard time wrapping their head around, which is why we’re here to help.</p>
